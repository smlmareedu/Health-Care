# Health-Care
A collection of healthcare data analysis projects focused on patient insights, disease trends, and data-driven decision-making using Excel, Python, SQL, and Power BI.
# ðŸ©º Healthcare Data Analysis Repository

## **Overview**
Welcome to the **Healthcare Data Analysis** repository â€” a comprehensive learning and practice hub designed for both **learners** and **professionals** interested in applying data analytics to the healthcare domain.

This repository explores healthcare data from multiple perspectives using **Excel**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Python** â€” showing how different technologies can be combined to uncover insights, optimize performance, and improve healthcare outcomes.

---

## **Objectives**
- To understand and analyze healthcare data from multiple tools and techniques  
- To perform end-to-end data analysis workflows â€” from **data cleaning** to **visualization**  
- To demonstrate how each technology contributes uniquely to healthcare analytics  
- To empower analysts to make **data-driven healthcare decisions**
